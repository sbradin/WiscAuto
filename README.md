Used the openCV documentation to learn how to pull the image, alter the colod gradient and thresholding, identify contours and draw them onto the image, find
the centroid of each contour after filtering for contours that were large enough to be deemed significant then plot a line through the start point and end point on 
each side of the image. 
I tried a variety of different ways to try to plot the line on the image and to identify any point on the contours and ways to differentiate the contours, but using the 
area of the contours to differentiate them and simply using the line() method provided in the openCV documentation was the easiest and most streamline way to complete
the challenge.
